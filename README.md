* Review: the instructor moves too fast and you will debug and figure out problems on your own, so good for experiencing fixing errors AND for exposure to new React stuff we haven't covered, bad for getting a video done quickly. Expect 45 minutes to an hour to complete

## Concepts covered

* Local storage so refreshing page keeps items on screen
* will return to update list (worth re/watching just for the new stuff)
